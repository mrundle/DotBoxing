DotBoxing is a networking, computer version of the popular napkin game, also known as squares, dots, dots and boxes, etc. 
It uses a server-client architecture to connect players.

To run the game:

Run the server on whatever machine you'd like, (just keep track of the hostname!):

	python server.py

Then, to run the game as a user, go into client.py and edit the "SERVER_HOST"
variable to reflect the machine that the server is currently running on.
(Note, this is on line 5 in client.py). Then run the game:

	python client.py

From here, enter a username and you're ready to go! Use the chat bar
to talk to other players, select users from the "Available" box and
challenge them to games, or just click the "Random Game" button to wait
for someone else to challenge you to play!

Note: Multiple users can and should use this game at once! The more the
merrier. Only one running server is necessary at any one time; all users
should simply connect to that one.
